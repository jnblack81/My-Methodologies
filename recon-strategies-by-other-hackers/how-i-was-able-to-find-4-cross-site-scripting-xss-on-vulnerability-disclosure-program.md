# üîé How I was able to find 4 Cross-site scripting (XSS) on vulnerability disclosure program ?

Hello I‚Äôm Amr Mustafa AKA DrakenKun

Today I‚Äôll explain how I found these reflected XSS vulnerabilities

First I will list the tools that I used during this process :-

1. ParamSpider
2. gau
3. kxss
4. Arjun

Let‚Äôs say our domain name called **example.com**

I used ParamSpider for finding some interested parameters

```
python3 paramaspider -d example.com -o parameters.txt 
```

We got a large number of parameters , now in the final output we can see every reflected parameters and unfiltered values. And here comes the role of kxss tool

I just typed :

```
cat parameters.txt | kxss 
```

The vulnerable parameter for XSS should have Unfiltered : **\[‚Äú ‚Äò < > $ | ( ) \` : ; { } ]**

I noticed here that I got 2 interested vulnerable parameters named **‚Äúgoto‚Äù** in different endpoints

let‚Äôs say the 2 links are

1. example.com/**login.jsp?goto=**

2\. cloud.example.com/**login.html?goto=**

Just visited the url and injected my simple payload in the parameter

```
"><img%20src=x%20onerror="alert(%27POC%20By%20DrakenKun%27)"
```

Also typed the same payload in the other url and javascript did his job :)

I reported these two vulnerabilities in Bugcrowd with some kind of satisfaction

After exactly 1 day

I asked myself , ok now if you got 2 vulnerable parameters both of them called **‚Äúgoto‚Äú** and possible for XSS

how about try finding more of any parameter has the same name ?!!

I simply used **google dorks**

typed ..

```
site:"example.com" inurl:"?goto="
```

I got some results but unfortunately aren‚Äôt vulnerable !

gave another chance ..

I used beautiful tool called [**gau**](https://github.com/lc/gau)

get all urls (gau) fetches known URLs from AlienVault's Open Threat Exchange, the Wayback Machine, Common Crawl, and URLScan for any given domain. Inspired by Tomnomnom's [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls).

Quite simply, all I want is finding any parameter called **‚Äúgoto‚Äù** to get any chance for finding new XSS‚Äôs

```
gau example.com | grep "?goto="
```

I visited every results and start inject javascript payloads

and guess what happened ?

Yeah :)

got the third XSS with some basic payload to Bypass the WAF

```
<%2FScriPt><sCripT+class%3DDrakenKun>document.write(document.cookie);<%2FsCriPt>
```

Now we got 3 :D

The 3 XSS‚Äôs are in 3 different endpoints

I visited them again and start finding any parameters for testing

Here I used tool called **Arjun**

```
arjun -u example.com/login.jsp
```

I got some parameters here and start inject every one of them

one of these parameters is called **‚ÄúSPID‚Äù** , I noticed that both characters ‚Äú< >‚Äù are refelcted on the source code !

And I quickly start typing my payload

```
"><img%20src=x%20onerror="alert(%27POC%20By%20DrakenKun%27)"
```

And Boom !!

I tried that with the other endpoints but I found nothing

I reported these 4 vulnerabilities and Alhamdulillah all of them accepted as Unresolved
